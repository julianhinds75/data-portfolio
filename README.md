# Jules Hinds â€“ Data Portfolio

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹  
Iâ€™m a Data Specialist who enjoys turning messy, real-world data into clear stories and visuals using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Power BI**.  
Below are a few of my recent analyses.

Each project includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visual storytelling focused on actionable insight rather than complex maths.
